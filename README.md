## Why

Rule-based testing is awesome! It forces you to look at problems from a different angle while promoting reuse and testability of your test code.

Iâ€™ve made this package because I could not find a suitable, existing framework written for rule-based testing.

## Getting started

First, add Rulebound to your project

```shell
npm install rulebound --save-dev
```

Rulebound is written in Typescript and therefore supports both Javascript and Typescript.

```javascript
// Require syntax
const { Rulebook } = require('rulebound');

const rulebook = new Rulebook();
```

```javascript
// Import syntax
import { Rulebook } from 'rulebound';

const rulebook = new Rulebook();
```

You can now add and execute your first rule.

```javascript
import { Rulebook } from 'rulebound';

const rulebook = new Rulebook();

rulebook.add('is-divisible')
    .define((number, factor) => {
        return (number % factor) === 0;
    });

await rulebook.enforce('is-divisible', 21, 7);
await rulebook.enforce('is-divisible', 11, 2); // => throws error
```

## Writing rules

Rules are typically defined as part of a rulebook. A rule consists of the following:

### Name _{string}_

```typescript
rulebook.add('string/max-length');
```

A rule name is a unique identifier that...

- MUST NOT contain any whitespace.
- SHOULD be a human-readable string.
- SHOULD use `/` and `-` as separators but MAY also use `_`, `@`, and `|`.
- SHOULD be kebab-cased.

### Configuration _{object}_

```typescript
rulebook.add('string/max-length', {
    maximum: 12,
});
```

A rule MAY have a rule-specific configuration. The default rule-specific configuration can be defined as above. The user can overwrite this via the Rulebound configuration file.

The parsed configuration can be accessed with `this.config` in the definition, punishment, and reward callback functions.

The precedence of configuration is as below where the bottom of the list overwrites the top.

- The default configuration for every rule
- The default configuration as specified when defining the rule
- User configuration for one or more rules (using glob pattern)
- User configuration for the specific rule

### Description _{string}_

```typescript
rule.describe(`
    This is a description. Any IDE formatting whitespace is stripped.
`);
```

A description SHOULD be added to the rule so humans know what the purpose of that rule is and what logic it contains. Putting some effort in this will make things a lot simpler for someone who has not written the rule.

### Alias _{string}_

```typescript
rule.alias('some-rule-name');
```

A rule MAY have an alias. This is defined by providing the name of another rule like above.

A rule with alias defined SHOULD NOT have any definitions as these will be ignored. When enforcing the definitions, punishments, and rewards of the target rule will be used after which the punishments and rewards of the rule with alias will be executed.

This allows you to use the same rule in different namespaces.

### Definition _{function}_

```typescript
// Semantic syntax
rule.define(function(inputValue) {
    return true;
});
```

```typescript
// Event based syntax
rule.on('enforce', function(inputValue) {
    return true;
});
```

A rule MUST have a definition. It's the part that is used to enforce it. A rule MAY have multiple definitions. A definition MAY have multiple arguments.

A rule can be defined with two distinct syntaxes (as above). There is no technical difference between these syntaxes.

#### Definition function arguments

When `enforce` is called the given arguments will be passed to the definition.

```typescript
rulebook.add('some-rule')
    .define(function(a, b) {
        console.log(a); // => 'someValue'
        console.log(b); // => 123
    })
    .enforce('some-rule', 'someValue', 123);
```

#### Breaking a rule

A rule is considered broken when the definition does one of the following:

- Throw an error.
- Return anything other than the boolean `true`.

#### Upholding the rule

A rule is considered upheld when the definition returns the boolean `true`.

### Punishment _{function}_

```typescript
rule.punishment(function(input, result) {
    throw new Error('Something bad happened');
});
```

```typescript
rule.on('fail', function(input, result) {
    throw new Error('Something bad happened');
});
```

A rule MAY have one or more punishments. When a rule is broken the defined punishments are automatically executed. When no punishment is provided the default punishment will be used.

Punishments can be defined with two distinct syntaxes (as above). There is no technical difference between these syntaxes.

#### Punishment function arguments

The following arguments are passed to the callback function:

| name    | type    | description    |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `input` | `any[]` | An array of the arguments passed to the `enforce` function |
| `result` | `any[] | Error` | An array containing the results of all `define` functions **or** a thrown error |

### Reward _{function}_

```typescript
rule.reward(function(input, result) {
    console.log('Yay, the rule is upheld!');
});
```

```typescript
rule.on('pass', function(input, result) {
    console.log('Yay, the rule is upheld!');
});
```

A rule MAY have one or more rewards. When a rule is upheld the defined rewards are automatically executed. When no reward is provided nothing will happen.

Rewards can be defined with two distinct syntaxes (as above). There is no technical difference between these syntaxes.

#### Reward function arguments

The following arguments are passed to the callback function:

| name    | type    | description    |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `input` | `any[]` | An array of the arguments passed to the `enforce` function |

## Testing rules

Since rules are self-contained pieces of code you can easily test them and the logic within. Doing this will take little execution time, as they're essentially unit tests, but will increase the quality of your tests tremendously.

The easiest way to show you how to test rules is with an example. The easiest way to do that is to [link to the integration tests of this repository](./test/integration). All the `*.spec.ts` files in the linked folder are testing their corresponding rule. In this repository, Mocha is used as the test runner and Chai as the assertion framework but the patterns transfer well to other test runners.

A few things to keep in mind when testing rules:

- Make sure a broken rule always results in an error. It would be a shame to have a rule punish but the test framework not failing the test. The easiest way to do this is to set `required: 'must'` for the duration of the test.
- Test the rule specific configuration and things related to it.
- Enforcing is async. Don't forget to `await`.

## Contributing

Contributors are always welcome! I don't care if you are a beginner or an expert, all help is welcome.

## Testing Rulebound

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then run the test script:

```plain
npm test
```

Sometimes things are just that simple.
